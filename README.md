  Devular's Gatsby Starter
</h1>

## üß• Bespoke Features

This Gatsby starter comes with a few features tailored to our particular needs, but we imagine a few other people will have had the same issues, hopefully it's useful to someone!

> Much of this work was done by [@leonoragilmour](https://github.com/leonoragilmour) in another project, and shamelessly copied into this repo by [@jonsherrard](https://github.com/jonsherrard), taking all the commmit-credit.

1. **Theme UI preconfigured**

   [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com) is argubly _the_ most powerful way to theme, style, and componentize React apps around. It's configured out of the box with a slew of plugins so you can get started styling with the `sx` prop, configure light and dark modes, and start theming with your `theme.js` file straight outta the gate.

2. **MDX powered blog**

   Why write any other way? Markdown blogging a-la Jekkyl is included out of the box, just create a new post in the `content/posts` folder to get started. MDX is supported, so you can `import` components into your blog and have them rendered in place as HTML, and running in the client as interactive JavaScript.

   Write components into `content/components` for use in your MDX blog, they have access to all packages, and will work with theme values out of the box.

3. **Simply and reliably add custom fonts**

   Every website uses them, why are they such a pain to configure? Worry no longer, simply run:

   ```sh
   npm run add-font ~/User/example/Downloads/my-fonts/font.org
   ```

   Our script will copy the file to the right place in Gatsby as well as generate all the font-face rules and
   config required to async load the font. Restart Gatsby (webfont-loader limitation), and you're ready to go.

   We use [https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) with Gatsby the following font platforms are also supported:

   - Adobe Edge Web Fonts
   - Fontdeck
   - Fonts.com
   - Google
   - Typekit

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the Devular starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the Devular Starter
    gatsby new my-gatsby-starter https://github.com/devular/devular-gatsby-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd my-gatsby-starter/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-ssr.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`/content`**: The directory will contain all of your blog posts, their assets, and components.

4.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

5.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

6.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

7.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

8.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

9.  **`gatsby-ssr.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby server-side rendering APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) (if any). These allow customization of default Gatsby settings affecting server-side rendering.

10. **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

11. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

12. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

13. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## üéì Learning Gatsby

Looking for more guidance? Full documentation for Gatsby lives [on the website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Here are some places to start:

- **For most developers, we recommend starting with our [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

- **To dive straight into code samples, head [to our documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).** In particular, check out the _Guides_, _API Reference_, and _Advanced Tutorials_ sections in the sidebar.
